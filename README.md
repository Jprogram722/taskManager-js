# taskManager-js

This is code for the taskManager-js app. The app uses Node.js and express.js on the back end to handle routing and server side rendering, ejs as a veiw engine, and MongoDB Atlus to store the code.

If you wanted to use this app with your own MongoDB Atlus database you can download the app by using `git clone [repo url]`.

Then install node.js on you computer from [Node.js Home](https://nodejs.org/en) along with express, mongoose, and dotenv by using `npm install [package]`.

then create your own .env file in the same directory as the project and put you MongoDB URI into the file like `MONGODB_URI=[YOUR URI]`.
